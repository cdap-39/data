    "content": "Colombo (News1st) – Over the past few days, News1st has been reporting on a Rs 10bn loan granted by People’s Bank to MTD Walkers PLC. The loan is special not only because it is the largest loan issued by the bank in its history but also because Jehan Amaratunge who sits on the People’s bank board of Directors also holds the position of Executive Deputy Chairman of MTD Walkers PLC.Senior Banker Rusiripala Tennakoon joining News1st for a special interview noted that Jehan Amaratunge has been serving as a member of the People’s bank, board of directors since 2010. He noted that it is very rare to see an individual continuing to serve for a long period of time especially in a backdrop where there was a change in Government.Tennakoon revealed that any related party transactions undertaken by a banking institution needs to be referred to an audit committee of the same bank. The senior banker also revealed that Amaratunge serves as the Chairman of the Audit Committee of People’s bank and that this itself is unethical.A MINISTERIAL EXPLANATIONThe matter relating to the Rs 10bn loan was raised during a media briefing in Colombo today. Journalists questioned whether Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera is aware of such a loan being granted.However, it was State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickremeratne who jumped at the opportunity to respond to the query. The State Minister noted that matters relating to loans are controlled by the management of the relevant bank and that ministers do not intervene in any shape or form in the decision-making process. He requested the journalists to pose this question to the bank itself.Minister Mangala Samaraweera explained that the banking sector does not fall under the purview of the Ministry of Finance. He noted that the subject minister in charge of banks is currently Lakshman Kiriella.Journalists then questioned the minister on whether obtaining such a loan was ethical? State Minister Wickremeratne responded by stating that there was a conflict of interest in this particular instance.A CONFLICT OF INTERESTMano Thittawella who is an adviser to the Ministry of Finance also arrived at the media briefing and journalists questioned him regarding the issue surrounding ETI Finance. It was Min. Mangala Samaraweera who responded to the journalists by stating that Thittawella was present at the location in his capacity as an advisor and requested the journalists to question him on ETI after the event. Min. Samaraweera was confident enough to say that his advisor would respond to the media after the event, unfortunately, Tittawella refused to comment on the record following the event.Minister Mangala Samaraweera and State Minister Eran Wickremeratne spoke about conflict of interest at the media briefing.Isn’t it a conflict of interest when the person who was the chairman and managing director of the EAP group to which ETI Finance belongs is now functioning as an advisor to the Ministry of Finance. Mano Thittawella also functions as a board member at Sri Lankan Airlines as well as the Secretary General of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms. During former governments, Mano Tittawella has held several key positions.Minister Malik Samarawickreme held an inspection tour of the construction of a Tyre factory in Horana recently along with Nandana Lokuvithana who is allegedly involved in financial misappropriation during the previous government. Lokuvithana is the current owner of Speville Ceylon of which Minister Malik Samarawickreme was functioning as a director in the past.Jehan Amaratunga who has obtained a loan of Rs. 10bn from the People’s Bank for his company has taken his post as director of the People’s Bank during the last government in the year 2010. All these individuals are working well to make sure that their objectives are reached.One could very well say that there seems to be no difference between the people that were in power before and the people in power today.In this myriad of depressing reports, there is a bright light, although it does come from the unlikeliest of persons.PROMISE OF AN INVESTIGATIONMinister of Public Enterprise Lakshman Kiriella speaking to News1st today noted that he has called for an immediate investigation into the Rs. 10bn loan granted by People’s bank.While stating that he got to know of this issue through the media the Minister noted that he had instructed his Ministry Secretary and the Chairman of the People’s bank to conduct an immediate inquiry and report back to him.We must praise this good measure taken by the Minister, which comes after a long time. Time will tell if this is just another empty promise made by another politician.",

    "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – UPFA Parliamentarian, Kanchana Wijesekera states that a couple of months ago, Minister Malik Samarawickrema brought an amazing proposal to the Cabinet. He stated that it was an amendment proposal for a mixed development project on a state-owned land, located down Baladaksha Mawatha between the Beira Lake and the Shangri La Hotel, which was to be implemented by Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited.MP Kanchana Wijesekara states that this proposal was among the land acts presented last week. According to him, this aim of this act was to provide the ownership of this land to the Singaporean company Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited. MP Kanchana goes on to state that, the state valuation for this land is Rs 12.5 mn per perch. The Parliamentarian notes that if the Government calls for tenders to lease out this land, they would be able to get a better price.Commenting on the same matter; Leader of the National Unity Alliance Party, Azath Salley states that Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited which is a Singaporean owned company, is requesting for another piece of land behind Shangri-La. He further explained that no one knows who the owner of this company is, except for Mano Thiththawella and Malik Samarawickrama.He said that his main concern was with regards to whose money is being invested in these projects? Salley questioned whether the money coming into the country was black money which was pumped out of the country.Azath Salley further explained that individuals come into Sri Lanka not only as investors, but also occupies positions in Malik Samarawickrama’s Private Companies.Elaborating further MP Azath Salley stated that the Singapore-Sri Lanka Trade Agreement is being criticized by everyone. He notes that the Trade Agreement bill was supposed to be sent back to the cabinet for further ratification but it was not. Azath Salley further states that when Min Malik was questioned regarding this matter, he has not clarified the matter. Ending the comment he states that they feel 174 papers of the agreement are missing and there’s nobody to assume responsibility in this matter.",

    "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – Myanmar has scaled back plans for a Chinese-backed port on its western coast, sharply reducing the cost of the project after concerns it could leave the Southeast Asian nation heavily indebted. A top government official and an advisor told Reuters the initial 7.3 billion US Dollar price tag on the port, set off alarm bells due to reports of troubled Chinese-backed projects in Sri Lanka and Pakistan.The Kyauk Pyu deepwater port is being constructed on the western tip of Myanmar’s conflict-torn Rakhine state. Deputy Finance Minister Set Aung, who was appointed to lead project negotiations in May, told Reuters the “project size has been tremendously scaled down”.The Deputy Minister said the revised cost would be “around 1.3 billion Dollars, something that’s much more plausible for Myanmar’s use”. China’s state-run CITIC Group, the main developer of the project, said negotiations were ongoing and that the 1.3 billion Dollars was to be spent on the “initial phase” of the port, adding the project was divided into four phases.The Kyauk Pyu port is a key part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road initiative, aimed at expanding trade links across the world. Kyauk Pyu is an entry point for a 770-kilometre pipeline delivering oil and natural gas to China’s Yunnan province.That gives China an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East that avoids the strategic chokepoint of the Malacca Strait. Construction on the port, and an accompanying special economic zone, which together were supposed to cost up to US$10 billion, was expected to start in 2018.But Myanmar officials said the experience of Sri Lanka, where this year the government signed over to China the lease on a strategic port to pay off Chinese-backed loans used to finance it, had raised concerns the country could be walking into a debt trap.The deputy finance minister of Myanmar said his country would give no sovereign guarantees for any loans financing the project.",

    "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – The Government aims to launch a project to develop the Ratmalana Airport as an International Airport and for the existing Sri Lankan Air Force Base and its operations to be moved elsewhere.While this project further upgrades the airport system of Sri Lanka, the Bandaranaike International Airport situated in the suburbs of Negombo is a fully functioning and well-equipped airport which serves it’s purpose. While the aim of refurbishing the Ratmalana Airport is well intended for sure, it is quite dubious on whether Sri Lanka has an urgent need for ‘another’ international airport.The Katunayake airport is undergoing resurfacing of its runway. According to Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited, future projects planned for the Katunayake airport, include a second runway to support the Airbus A380, a further eight passenger gates, a domestic terminal, a five-storeyed car-park, and a five-star hotel neighbouring the airport.With all the refurbishments to the Katunayake Airport included, it is a fair question to be raised as to why Sri Lanka plans to invest in upgrading the Ratmalana Domestic airbase, given the current economy and debt situation of the country.LEARNING FROM PAST MISTAKESIf we recall, the Good Governance Government came into power to rectify certain unaccounted decisions made by the previous regime. This includes the unwarranted construction of the Mattala airport, which is reported to be the World’s emptiest airport. Given the circumstances, it is questionable whether the current administration has learned anything from the mistakes of the past administration.Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala De Silva was questioned at a press conference, whether the refurbishment of the Ratmalana airbase is an attempt to sell off the airport, like the Government’s plans for the Mattala airport. Min. Nimal Siripala seemed a bit agitated by the question as he fired back rhetorical questions at the journalists. He stated emphatically that there is no idea of selling the Ratmalana airport or the Mattala Airport.In a speech given at the parliament on 6 June 2018, Min. Nimal Siripala, speaking on the Mattala airport, states that a project plan was put forward by the Indian Airport Authority, to be initiated as a Joint Venture. He states that the discussion was on establishing a separate controlling legal entity (Private company) by the Sri Lankan Government and the Indian Airport Authority, where the Indian Authority plans to buy 70% of the shares of the newly established company. According to Min. Nimal Siripala the discussions with India are ongoing and the parties haven’t reached a decision yet. He also reassures that the 70% equity investment by the Indian Airport Authority could be used in servicing the debt of the country.However, claims that the Indian Airport Authority was interested in the Mattala airport was rejected by the Indian Minister of State for Civil Aviation in the Lok Sabha recently.ANOTHER WHITE-ELEPHANT?A rational question that arises is where Sri Lanka would find the funds necessary to develop the Rathmalana airport, is it through another loan or through some Government fund. Either way is this really how the Government should invest this money given the current situation of the economy and the cost of living?The question is will the Rathmala Airport become the Good Governance Government’s Mattala.",

    "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – Since the current administration was elected to power there have been a plethora of taxes imposed on the general public. The cost of living is on the rise and it seems that this unbearable cost of living is beginning to take a toll on our elected public representatives as well.It could be because of this very reason that they are planning on giving themselves a pay rise, as a pat on the back for the hard work that they have put in to improve the state of the country over the past 3 years. Several newspapers reported on Thursday (Aug. 2nd) quoting parliamentary sources that our public representatives stand to benefit from a whopping 215% pay increase.How will the Government pass such a proposal through Parliament? By simply ensuring that this pay increase benefits everyone across the board. Yes! the proposal seeks to increase the salaries of Ministers, Deputy Ministers, State Ministers and Parliamentarians, thus ensuring bipartisan support in Parliament which is rarely seen in any matter of national concern.The media reports indicate that the proposal to increase the salaries came up for discussion during the party leaders meeting held on the 17th of July. The reports add that the salary increment would be retrospectively applied from January this year and that it would be paid this month with the arrears.CRUNCHING THE NUMBERSThe current salary of a member of Parliament is Rs.54,285. If this proposed salary increment does come into play MPs will see their monthly salary rise to Rs.120, 000.The monthly salary of a Deputy Minister is set to increase from Rs.63,500 to Rs 135,000, while the salaries drawn by Ministers and State Ministers would increase from Rs.65,000 to Rs.140,000.In addition to all this, since 2016 each and every member of Parliament receives a Rs 100,000 office allowance and a Rs. 50,000 phone allowance. Not forgetting the myriad of perks and benefits enjoyed by those in the Government.It is not surprising that the move to increase the salaries of members of Parliament has been met with outrage by the members of the general public who are requested to tighten their belts because of the enormous debt burden that the current government says it has to deal with, at every possible occasion.GOOD GOVERNANCEMinister of Home Affairs Vajira Abeywardene attended an event in Kegalle today and as he was leaving the location of the event, he was questioned by Journalists. The question that was posed was simple “how fair is it to increase salaries by 215% when the economy is in such a state.” The Minister no doubt shocked and taken aback by the report that he stands to receive a pay rise, simply walked away smiling with his index finger pressed to his lips, as if to say shhh! don’t jinx it.Former Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage speaking to the media noted that it is unfair to increase the salaries of Parliamentarians in a backdrop where taxes imposed on the general public keeps rising.Addressing a media briefing General Secretary of the United National Freedom Front, Maithri Gunratne questioned if this is what the current administration classifies as “good governance.” Gunaratne spoke about the actions of Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who proposed a 20% pay cut for all parliamentarians taking into consideration the status of the economy. He noted that the situation in Sri Lanka is completely different.Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera was also questioned by the media on Thursday (Aug 2nd) on the reports of a possible salary increase for MPs. Minister Samaraweera noted that personally, he is against the salaries of anyone being increased at this current point of time. He noted that whatever discussions are held, the final decision has to come through him.It is admirable that the Minister of Finance feels this way in a personal capacity, however, can he withstand pressure from his peers and superiors when the time comes to make the crucial decision. Will it be country before self or vice versa?",

The letter says that as a step to reduce the risk while carrying out daily business activities, banks offer various loans and it invests in the stock market, treasury bonds and treasury bills as well as on debentures.The letter reads the People’s Bank invested 500 million rupees in debentures in 2015 issued by MTD Walkers PLC at an interest rate of 9.75 percent. As per the letter, the approval had been granted after the earning ratio of the investors were compared.The  People’s Bank says the interest rate at which loans would be granted to other parties usually stood at 13.11% at the time this investment was done. The letter says, after paying income tax the net interest rate of the bank stood at 9.44 percent and the interest rate for treasury bonds and treasury bills stood at 7.08%. The letter goes onto note that since income tax is exempted on interest income received by debentures, the bank had received more benefits.Rusiripala Tennakone meanwhile notes that the finances of the People’s Bank is not so weak as to warrant an investment in debentures from a company which is being closely scrutinized by the Colombo Stock Exchange. He questions, as to why money was invested in debentures of this company when there were several other options, where a high-interest rate could be earned or a higher income could be earned. He questions whether this transaction was prompted by an individual who was both a part of the People’s Bank and MTD Walkers PLC",

    "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – The middle-income earners of this country dream of one day having a vehicle of their own – but it appears that dream is fading away gradually. Prices of goods increase by the day while the rupee depreciated to a record low in the not too distant past, not forgetting that interest rates increased by 03% as well.Isn’t the looting of public funds from the Central Bank Treasury Bond Scam the main reason for these aggravating issue that burden the general public?The immediate loss from the 1st Bond Issue dated the 27th of February 2015 was estimated by the Auditor General as over Rs. 896 Million. It now stated that by the end of the maturity period of 30 years for this bond, the loss to the state will be in the Billions and could even reach the level of Trillions of rupees.The most dangerous aspect of this Bond Scam is that those involved had tampered with the Employees Provident Fund. The EPF is where the working masses deposit a portion of their hard earned monthly salary – shedding blood, sweat, and tears for many years. Sadly, the money which the people hope of taking back when they reach retirement too had been looted from this scam and its reach is such that it had forced taxes to be imposed on the remainder of the fund.The loss caused by the first bond scam has been revealed thus far. However, while the investigations on the bond scam took place, in 2016 another bond scam took place, and loss caused by this is far greater than the first.Speaking to the media the Executive director of the CaFFE Keerthi Tennakoon said it is clear that the information relating to the Second Bond Scam was limited when it was inquired by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry. He said it must be made clear that the financial fraud of over Rs. 11 Billion is only connected to the first bond scam.Keerthi Tennakoon added that they are attempting to state the total loss of around Rs. 12 Billion and there is no truth to this, it has affected the funds of the Unversity Grants Commission, the Mahapola, Central Bank Funds, the EPF, the ETF, the National Saving Bank, the People’s Bank as well as the Insurance Corporation. The total loss from this scam is Rs. 32 BIllion Rupees or even more, said Keerthi Tennakoon adding that investigations must take place with regard to this second bond scam.",

    "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – The tenure of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCOI) appointed to investigate irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, Mihin Lanka & SriLankan catering was extended by five months.THE SHARE ANOMALYA serious anomaly in the registration of shares purchased from Emirates was exposed at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Wednesday (August 1st). In 2006 the Government of Sri Lanka owned 51.05% of the shares of SriLankan Airlines, while Emirates-owned 43.63% and others owned 5.32%.However, in 2010 an understanding had been reached to sell the 43.63% shares of Emirates to the Government of Sri Lanka. This is evident in a letter addressed to Former Secretary of Finance Dr. P.B. Jayasundara from the Chairman of Emirates Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum.At the time the Government Valuation Department had determined that the Government-owned shares were valued at 450 Million US Dollars. It was said today that Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Minister of Finance had produced a memorandum to the Cabinet on the 1st of June 2010 and it notes that approval was granted to Bank of Ceylon (BOC) to explore the possibility in purchasing the Emirates shares for 53 Million US Dollars.According to the documents, on the 20th of June 2010 – 22,451,516 shares owned by Emirates were transferred to BOC for 53 Million US Dollars. What is surprising is that as of 30th August 2010 when SriLankan registered the shares, BOC had 12,115,517 shares, People’s Bank 4,236,135 shares, National Savings Bank 4,236,135 shares, and the EPF had 1,863,676 shares.However, there is no Cabinet Paper available to say that the Treasury approved the other state institutions to purchase the Emirates shares, despite the fact that the Cabinet only approved Bank of Ceylon to purchase the shares.SECURITY VIOLATION?Titus Kannangara the Senior Manager Security and Investigations at SriLankan Airlines Ltd. testifying today said it took the national carrier almost two and a half years to install an X-Ray scanning system at the Katunayake Airport.He said the original tender was canceled in 2014 citing an alleged security threat from the LTTE and the three X-Ray devices were only installed at the airport in 2016 & 2017. The airline had entered into individual 07-year service agreements with the supplier for Explosive Trace Detectors (ETD) and all of them were signed on the 31st of August 2016 by Major General ( Rtd.) P. Chandrawansa, the Head of Group Security.The ETDs were installed at the airport on the 15th of August 2016, two weeks before the service agreement was even signed. What should be noted is that the contract review form, which is a document signed by other user departments vetting the procurement, had been signed on the 18th of May 2016.The issue highlighted by the Attorney Generals Department is that the user departments had approved the procurement even before the ETDs were shipped to Sri Lanka.Titus Kannangara also confirmed that the HR Department at SriLankan Airlines requested him to release on 07 security personnel attached to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya, who were on duty, for election campaigning in Pelmadulla on the 27th of December 2014, for the political party that was in power at the time.The Collective bargaining agreement between the trade union and SriLankan Airlines clearly notes personnel cannot be released for any political activity.",

On Tuesday the Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union officially inquired from the People’s Bank on the Rs. 10bn loan.The Deshaya weekend newspaper reported on Sunday that the Rs. 10bn loan was granted to a company affiliated with the Director of People’s Bank. Upon further investigations conducted by News 1st, it was revealed that the loan was approved by the Loans Committee of People’s Bank where Jehan Amaratunge is a Board Member, for MTD Walkers PLC, where he holds the position of Executive Deputy Chairman,.General Secretary of the Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union, Ranjan Senanayake speaking to News1st explained that they had made a written inquiry to the administration of the People’s Bank to ascertain whether the necessary procedures were followed in issuing this loan.OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONIssuing a release on Tuesday to make clarifications on the matter, Chairman of People’s Bank Hemasiri Fernando said MTD Walkers PLC have had trusted dealings with the People’s Bank since 2004, adding the repayments for the constant financial lendings it granted were carried out in a proper and systematic manner. The People’s Bank Chairman points out the loan facility was awarded in adherence to the regulations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.Hemasiri Fernando’s release says the loan was granted with the approval of the Board of Directors in accordance with the recommendations of the Board’s Loans Committee which comprises of three members of the bank’s Board of Directors and Senior Officials of the Loan Board. The People’s Bank Chairman goes on to note the Board of Directors approved the loan only after ensuring that all requirements of the Central Bank were met.Hemasiri Fernando had stressed that when granting loan facilities, the People’s Bank only takes into account the proper procedure and not the recommendations or interferences of any other person or institution.Meanwhile, former People’s Bank Chairman Rusiripala Tennakoon says he has received reports that a Rs. 1bn loan granted to MTD Walkers PLC was classified as a non-performing loan on the 29th of July. He revealed that the People’s Bank had invested Rs. 500mn in MTD Walkers PLC debentures at an interest rate of 9.75%. Rusiripala Tennakoon says this is a considerably low-interest rate adding that a state bank making an investment at such a low-interest rate is questionable.As at the 31st of December 2015, People’s Bank was the 4th largest shareholder of MTD Walkers PLC. Niranjan Deva Aditya who is a close associate of the Prime Minister is also an Independent Non-Executive Director of this company.The leader of the National Unity Alliance, Azath Salley commenting on the matter noted that there is nothing the board of directors of the People’s bank could do as this incident was about Jehan Amaratunge who is a friend of Minister Malik Samarawickrama. Salley accused the Samarawickrama of using his influence to pass this loan through both the bank and the central bank.Déjà vuDo you remember how the Central Bank Treasury Bond Scam took place? It has now been proven that the father-in-law from with the Central Bank acted in a manner that benefited his son-in-law to the tune of billions of public funds.Isn’t it a conflict of interest when a Director of a State Bank approves a loan for another company he is affiliated with?

    "heading": "What is happening to the bond scam inquiry?",
    "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – Three years ago the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, under Governor Arjuna Mahendran, advertised a bond of Rs. 1 Billion for 30 years. Despite the passage of time, there is a remarkable absence of legal action being taken.Although the advertised amount was Rs. 1 Billion and the Public Debt Department recommended that an amount Rs. 2.06 Billion be taken up after the bids were received, then Governor Arjuna Mahendran acted in what turned out to be wrongful, improper, mala fide, fraudulent and in gross breach of his duties as Governor.The principal beneficiary of these deviant actions by the governor was a company named Perpetual Treasuries Limited which just happened to be owned and controlled by the family of his son in law Arjun Aloysius. After News 1st highlighted growing concerns of a conflict of interest and a departure from a procedure on the 16th of March 2015, Arjuna Mahendran admitted his liability on one aspect of this scam.In a telephone conversation with News1st, Mahendran admitted that he should have advertised for 10 billion rupees instead of one. The very next day (March 17th, 2015), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a statement in Parliament. He said he insisted on a public auction because private placements had led to corruption and lack of transparency. In this statement, the Prime Minister as the Minister in charge of the Central Bank told Parliament that it was he who insisted on the change in the way that bonds be awarded.Thereafter the Prime Minister appointed a three-member Committee of UNP loyalists ( the Pitipana Committee) who had no knowledge of CBSL operations. Following the conclusion of this committee’s activities, COPE investigated the matter – where Mahendran admitted that he “only did as he was instructed to by the Prime Minister”. The Second COPE observed that Arjuna Mahendran was accountable for the loss.In the face of growing public concern and civil society calls President Sirisena appointed a Presidential Commission of inquiry headed by two Supreme Court Judges. 11 Months later, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry handed in its report to the President. This was in a backdrop of claims that Bond Report had found its way to a private residence prior to reaching the Presidential Palace and serious claims that a certain number of pages of this report are hidden or are being kept hidden.In a complete departure from process and procedure, President’s Secretary Austin Fernando decided to archive the entire report, ensuring that the report is kept away from public eyes for the next 30 years. Incidentally the first bond had its maturity date in 30 years.During the Presidential Commission’s proceedings, the Prime Minister was asked to appear as a witness and instead of a personal initial appearance he was sent a questionnaire and expected to reply in the form of an affidavit. When the Prime Minister did turn up at the commission, it was the Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya himself who questioned him, not individuals such as Yasantha Kodagoda or Dappula De Livera who had been thorough in their examination of other witnesses. The Attorney General’s questioning of the Prime Minister was met with strong criticism from the legal fraternity.Ministers Malik Samarawickrama and Kabir Hashim were questioned only for a few minutes and their questioning too attracted criticism.A SERIOUS ANOMALYPrime Minister Wickremesinghe on the 17th of March 2015 admitted he insisted on the change in the way the bonds are issued.  Arjuna Mahendran appearing before COPE stated he only followed the PMs instructions. Yet, the Bond Report does not address directly the PMs admission and Mahedran’s concurrence on the very subject.The Commission has recommended legal action against Arjuna Mahendran, several officials of CBSL, Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena of PTL and several others.The Director General of the Bribery Commission Sarath Jayamanne has openly stated that the existing laws do not permit the commission to use the evidence from the Bond Commission in any prosecution. The proposed amendment to the laws has to be passed by Parliament where the matter has not even been given a debate thus far.It is remarkable that this entire exercise apart from being a conflict of interest scenario does not enjoy the serious attention of elected Parliamentarians to enable a change in the law and therefore the prosecution.All this is in a backdrop where the second bond issuance, seven times the amount of the first, remains uninvestigated.",

The report adds that the loan facility has been approved at multiple stages and had also received the approval of the bank’s board of directors and loans committee.When the Deshaya newspaper had made inquiries from the Chairman of the State Bank, he had confirmed the report of the loan adding that the loan had gone through the proper channels. The state bank chairman was also questioned on whether there was no conflict of interests, given the connections between the director and the group of companies that had been granted the loan, however, he had said that he could not respond.Inquiries made by News 1st revealed that the loan of 10 billion rupees had been made to CML Walkers, a construction contractor by the state-owned People’s Bank. Responding to inquiries made by News 1st, the Chairman of the Large Scale Loan Board at People’s Bank, Dr. Aminda Methsila noted that the Bank had already loaned about 50 billion rupees to this company as at 2014.He noted that the company had repaid this loan. Dr. Methsila added that accordingly, loans could be issued to the company in question, with a credit limit of 50 billion rupees.According to the 106/2017 Annual Report of CML Walkers, Jehan Amaratunge is the Executive Vice President of the Group. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of People’s Bank and has served in that position since 2010.The Chairman of the Bank at the time of Amaratunge’s appointment was Gamini Senarath.The company CML Walkers has been awarded contracts for the construction of many government projects including roads and bridges – among these is the contract for the construction of a section of stage 2 of the Central Expressway.Is it fair for an individual who serves as a director of a state bank to obtain a 10 billion rupee loan from that bank to benefit his private businesses?

    "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, leader of the JVP stats that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is yet to reject the claim that he recieved US$ 7.6 Million (Rs. 1.1 Billion) from a Chinese company.“Last week all the details, about the number of cheques, how they were transferred to the banks and who transferred them were revealed in Parliament. It wouldn’t have mattered to us if a Chinese company gave this money to Mahinda of Medamulana. But instead, it was given to President Mahinda.”, he added.The JVP leader also spoke about the companies in question.“One constructed a port, another an airport, another built Norochcholai and the other built the South Container Terminal of the Colombo Port. So isn’t this a good reason enough for us to assume that these were constructed solely for the purpose of getting money? Or else what other interests does China have to pay money to a Sri Lankan President?” Anura Kumara questioned.The Parliamentarian then set his sights on  Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, saying that no one can hide the fact that “Ranil Wickremesinghe is involved in the bond scam”.He also recalled questioning the PM in parliament on the bond scam, few weeks after the incident. “He denied, saying nothing like that happened, which instantly proved that it did. So the man (Arjuna Mahendran) scooted off to Singapore. It was Ranil who protected him after the theft and it was Ranil who helped him flee the country as well. So does this not make him the person behind the theft? What other proof do you need? This kind of evidence is not detrimental to a case. There is something called circumstantial evidence based on which the court can make a decision. Which is why I say Ranil is directly involved in this deal..”It is well known that the bond scam caused monumental losses to Sri Lanka. It is the largest incident of defrauding state funds in the political history of the country. Through parliament, civil society, the Committee on Public Enterprises and the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, the manner in which this crime was carried out and the perpetrators, were exposed.While this is the major topic of conversation on the political stage, on whose interference is the recovery of these funds and the punishment of the perpetrators being delayed continuously?The people do not want to listen to stories anymore – they want the perpetrators to be punished.The people are watching.",
